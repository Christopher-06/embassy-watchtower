# Embassy Visor

**Embassy Visor** is the host-side analysis tool for **Embassy Watchtower**, an unofficial, community-driven task profiler, visualizer, and debugger.

This crate is responsible for ingesting, parsing, and visualizing the `defmt` trace data streamed from your microcontroller. It acts as the interface between you and the raw data generated by `embassy-beacon`.

## Usage

If your firmware project is already instrumented with `embassy-beacon`, you can simply launch the visor to start monitoring your Embassy tasks in real-time.

Run the visor from your terminal:

```shell
embassy-visor
```
## Advanced Usage

You can also run the visor with additional parameters (e.g., using --release for compiled optimizations for your microcontroller):
```shell
embassy-visor --release
```
